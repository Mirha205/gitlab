        <h2>Getting Started with Career Mode</h2>

        <h3>Create Your Player</h3>
        <ul class="feature-list">
            <li><strong>Customization:</strong> Start by creating your player. You can tweak everything from their looks to their position and skills. Think about what type of player you want to be—sharpshooter, playmaker, or defensive ace.</li>
            <li><strong>Skill Points Allocation:</strong> Use your skill points wisely. Boost the attributes that match your playstyle but don’t neglect your weaknesses.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Beginning Your Career</h3>
        <ul class="feature-list">
            <li><strong>College Selection:</strong> Pick a college team to kick off your journey. Performing well in college games will make a big difference when draft day rolls around.</li>
            <li><strong>Draft Day:</strong> How you perform in college and pre-draft activities determines your draft position. Aim high to get picked by a team that suits your style.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Essential Tips for Success</h2>

        <h3>Improve Your Skills</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Training and Drills:</strong> Regular training and drills are key. They not only improve your player’s skills but also earn you extra skill points.</li>
            <li><strong>Focus on Weaknesses:</strong> Identify where your player is lacking and work on those areas. Becoming a well-rounded player is crucial.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>In-Game Performance</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Team Play:</strong> Basketball is a team sport. Pass the ball, set screens, and follow your coach’s strategies. Team play earns you more minutes on the court.</li>
            <li><strong>Scoring Opportunities:</strong> Look for the best scoring opportunities. Efficient scoring improves your player’s rating and your standing with the team.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Off-Court Activities</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Endorsements:</strong> As you progress, you’ll get endorsement deals. These deals bring in extra VC (Virtual Currency), which you can use to upgrade your player.</li>
            <li><strong>Social Media:</strong> Engage with fans and media to boost your popularity and attract more endorsement deals.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Advanced Strategies</h2>

        <h3>Game Strategy</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Game Tactics:</strong> Learn different game tactics and adjust your playstyle accordingly. Knowing offensive and defensive plays gives you an edge.</li>
            <li><strong>Watch Replays:</strong> Study game replays to see where you went wrong and how you can improve.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Upgrading Attributes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Balanced Development:</strong> Don’t pour all your points into one attribute. A balanced player is more versatile and valuable.</li>
            <li><strong>Specialize:</strong> If you want to specialize, make sure your team covers the areas where you might be weaker.</li>
        </ul>
